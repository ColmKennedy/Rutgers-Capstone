# Rutgers-Capstone Airbnb Predictions

## Work in Progress

Although this project is complete, I am currently in the process of documenting and uploading my code here. Currently, the most complete stage is the plots.ipynb notebook. Here you can see some of the most meaningful plots I found during Exploratory Data Analysis. If you would like to dive deeper into the analysis, check out EDA.ipynb. Although this notebook is not yet fully documented and edited, it contains much of my Data Analysis for this project.

## Introduction

This project was completed in May of 2023 as my capstone project to recieve the Data Science minor at Rutgers University. The goal of this project was to use information from Airbnb listings in New York city, to build a model to accurately predict the price of an Airbnb listing, based on known features. The data used in this project was provided by Rutgers University, and contained tens of thousands of New York City listings. Although the listings themselves were real, some of the features were modified or created by the Professor, in order to create some additional noise and/or signal in the data. The data required much cleaning, and contained many missing values. Upon submission, a 'test' dataset was provided to generate the Kaggle submission (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-science-capstone-project-2023). This 'test' dataset contained new listings, with the target variable (price) ommitted. The files in this repository are Jupyter notebooks and R scripts containing the Python and R code I used to clean, analyze, model, and predict this data. 

## Mission Statement

Utilizing features known at the time of listing, this model will accurately predict a competitive market price for each unique listing. Additionaly, through data analysis and hypothesis testing, this project will infer what features affect the price of an Airbnb listing.

## Table of Contents

* EDA.ipynb - Exploratory Data Analysis. This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code utilized to analyze the training set of Airbnb listings. It contains tables, plots, and descriptive statistics, as well as the necessary cleaning to perform these operations.
* plots.ipynb - Impactfull Plots. This Jupyter Notebook contains the most usefull plots from EDA, which will later be used in the final presentation.
